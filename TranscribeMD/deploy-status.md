# TranscribeMD Deployment Status

## GitHub Actions Workflow Added âœ…

The following files have been added to enable automatic deployment:

- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
- `.nojekyll` - Prevents Jekyll processing
- `package.json` - Project metadata

## Next Steps to Enable GitHub Pages:

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/Drei010/TranscribeMD
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section (in the left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**, select **"Deploy from a branch"**
5. Choose **Branch**: `gh-pages` and **Folder**: `/ (root)`
6. Click **Save**

### 2. Check GitHub Actions

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. You should see the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow running
3. Wait for it to complete (usually takes 2-3 minutes)

### 3. Access Your Live Application

Once deployment is complete, your app will be available at:
**https://drei010.github.io/TranscribeMD/**

## Automatic Deployment

From now on, every time you push changes to the `main` branch, the application will automatically be deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Troubleshooting

If the deployment fails:
1. Check the **Actions** tab for error messages
2. Ensure the repository is public (GitHub Pages requires public repos for free accounts)
3. Wait a few minutes for the first deployment to complete

## Local Development

To run the app locally:
```bash
# Using Python (if installed)
python -m http.server 8000

# Or simply open index.html in your browser
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`
